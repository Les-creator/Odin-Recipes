        <h2>Recipe</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>3 cups of flour</li>
             <li> 1 1/2 cups of warm water</li>
             <li> 1 tsp of salt</li>
             <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
             <li> Extra rapsolja or any vegetable oil for frying</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Step by step directions</h2>

         <ol>
             <li> Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl.</li>

                <li>2. Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 Â½ cups of water in a separate jar/ bowl. 
                Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.</li>
                
                <li>Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1) and mix well.</li>
                
                <li>Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until the dough becomes 
                non-sticky. Add 2-3 tbsp of oil and continue kneading until the oil mixes well 
                and the dough is soft. Cover the dough and leave it for 40 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 - 15 equal parts making ball 
                like shapes. Arrange them in a flat surface dusted with flour(Cover with a damp 
                tablecloth to avoid drying).</li>
                
                <li>Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start rolling with
                 a rolling pin to a circular shape, brush oil on top and roll it inwards to form
                  a shape-like a rope, then create a coil-like shape and press the ball down with
                   your palm to make it flat. Repeat this process to the rest of the remaining
                    balls of dough.</li>
                
                <li>Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the rolling pin 
                to form a circular shape again.</li>
                
                <li>In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each side with 
                little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. Place your cooked chapati in a 
                flat plat and cover with an aluminum foil.</li>
                
                <li>Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough.</li>
                
                <li>Serve with your favourite stew</li>
